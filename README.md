A website where I can create blog posts that then display on a second page

The website lands on the form page which is the index.html. When the user submits the form it is stored in local storage then redirects to the blog.html where the data from local storage is displayed.

In both blog.js and form.js I commented out my original code for reference when trying to figure out why my local storage was being overidden. With the help of stackoverflow, w3schools, and Xpert Learning assitant 
I fixed this issue.

Also in form.js I have a comment "WHAT I LEARNED:" That notes what code helped me overcome this bug. 

what still needs to be done is some better css formatting and a theme-switcher for light and dark mode
